# CourseProject_CleaningData
This repository was created to submit the course project for the Coursera Class Getting and Cleaning Data

This README file describes the steps taken in the script run_analysis.R to process data from created by the Human Activity Recognition Experiment by the Universit√† degli Studi di Genova, Genoa. The authors built a database from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. For more information regarding the data set visit :http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones


The data resulting for the experiment was made available in several files. The purpose of this script is to process and cleanse the data of all those files and produce one set of tidy data that can be used by others to better understand the results of the experiment. 

A detailed description of the cleansed dataset produced by this script, can be found in the code book file located in this same repository.

This script assumes that all related files are available on the working directory used to run the script. This is the list of files used by this script and a brief description of them.

General Files:
features.txt : Contains the name of each one of the variables captures for every observation of the experiment
activity_labels.txt: Contains a description of the activity being performed while measures were collected as well as a unique integer indetifier for each activity.

Test Data Set Files:
X_test.txt: Contains the measurements collected for each one of the observations of the experiment
subject_test.txt: Contains an integer identifying the subject perfroming the activity for each one of the observations
y_test.txt: Contains an integer representing the activity being performed for each oone of the observations

Train Data Set Files:
X_train.txt: Contains the measurements collected for each one of the observations of the experiment
subject_train.txt: Contains an integer identifying the subject perfroming the activity for each one of the observations
y_train.txt: Contains an integer representing the activity being performed for each oone of the observations


Combining all files together
The general flow of the script is to load the data and then put together the test and train datasets since they have been provided to us in 3 different files but in reality they are all related to the same observation. This is accomplished by loading each of the files (X, subject and Y) and adding a sequence number for each of the rows. Once the 3 files have been loaded and have a "id" column, we proceed to join those 3 files and end up with one dataframe for the Test Dataset. The same process is repeated with the train data to end up with  one dataframe with all data for the set. 

Once that we have a dataset for Train and another for Test we proceed to combine those datasets to end up with one dataframe that has all the observations.

It is important that we rename the columns of the dataframes along the way to make sure we endup with descriptive names that give the user a good idea of what is stored in that column.

Cleaning data and make it more legible for the user
Antother important point is to handle the files that are applicable to both the test and train datasets. The first one is the activity_labels.txt. This file has the name of the measurents contained in the X_train and X_test files. We load the activity_labels.txt in a dataframe and then we cleanup the names by removing parenthesis , commas and other characters. We alos apply the functio make.names to make sure all names are syntactically correct in R. Then we assing this vector to the names of the dataframe containing the X_train data. By doing this we have named each one of the 561 elements on the dataset.

The features.txt file is used to translate the activy identifier to an activity description. The activity identifier was given to each one of the observations but it has no meaning for the user unless they have access to this file. To make our data set clearer we load the features.txt set and then we join it to the combined data frame containing both test and train data. By doing this now we have descriptive names for each activity (i.e. Walking, Standing, etc.)

Preparing data to produce desire output
Once we have loaded the data, stitched together we move to the next step which is preparing and transforming the data to desired final output. The first thing we do is remove some of the column of the data frame, since we have several (561) and the requirement calls to use only a subest. In this case we use the command select to remove all the columns that are not neede. The next step we use the function melt to creat a long and skinny version of the data . In a way we have converted the columns of the data set in rows, this is necessary so we can apply some of the functions needed to summarize the data. To achieve the summarization we use dcast and specify that we want to summarize the data by subject and activity and use the mean of all the measures as a way to group the data.

The last step is to replace the acitvity id for an actual activity description. We achieved this by loading the activities labels file and joinig that dataframe to our main dataframe. Finally we rearrange the columns to make it cleaner for the end user and drop the activity id column that is no longer necessary.
